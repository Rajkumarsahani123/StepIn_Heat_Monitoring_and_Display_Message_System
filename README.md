# StepIn_Heat_Monitoring_and_Display_Message_System

### Title: Heat_Monitoring_and_Display_Message_System

The CaseActivity â€œHeat monitoring and Display Message System is done  in Embedded C programming language interfacing with ATMEGA328 Microcontroller using Code blocks, SimulIDE and  WinAVR software.The main issues in a temperature monitoring system are how the system communicates with the user, if the temperature is beyond the stable temperature defined by the user. It is a system that is applied to detecttemperature and display the value of temperature on the monitor, as well asit will be displayed on the LDC screen.The graph of the temperature variation with respect to time will be displayed on the monitor, which willgive the value of temperature every second. While the monitoring system uses a computer system to monitoring the temperature data.

## Research

### Objectives:
1.This system aims to simplify the task of maintaining Temperature inside the vehicles.

2.To know whether the passenger is seated or not

3.To display proper temperature value on LCD Screen.

4.Should be user friendly.
 
## SWOT Analysis
