# StepIn_Heat_Monitoring_and_Display_Message_System

### Title: Heat_Monitoring_and_Display_Message_System

The CaseActivity â€œHeat monitoring and Display Message System is done  in Embedded C programming language interfacing with ATMEGA328 Microcontroller using Code blocks, SimulIDE and  WinAVR software.The main issues in a temperature monitoring system are how the system communicates with the user, if the temperature is beyond the stable temperature defined by the user. It is a system that is applied to detecttemperature and display the value of temperature on the monitor, as well asit will be displayed on the LDC screen.The graph of the temperature variation with respect to time will be displayed on the monitor, which willgive the value of temperature every second. While the monitoring system uses a computer system to monitoring the temperature data.

## Research

### Objectives:
1.This system aims to simplify the task of maintaining Temperature inside the vehicles.

2.To know whether the passenger is seated or not

3.To display proper temperature value on LCD Screen.

4.Should be user friendly.
 
## SWOT Analysis
### Strength: 
Easy to access this system and cost effective 

### Weakness: 
Modification required as the Technology changes.

### Opportunity: 
It can be use for high scale user requirement like Home, Office etc.

### Threats: 
Since its is harware based  system so getting damage is high chances.

## 4W's and 1H's

### Who
. All the automobiles industries can apply this system.

### What
. Its a kind of manual system to turn on and off the AC in the vehicles

### When
. This system can be use according to the atmosphere condition.

### Where
. This system is specially used on the place where winter season is there forever.

### How
. This system takes inputs from the person and then its start working.

## Folder Structure

| Folder  |  Description |   
|---|---|
|  1_Requirements |Documents detailing requirements   |  
| 2_Architecture  | Structural and Behavioural UML  |  
|  3_Implementation | All the code is written here  |     
| 4_Simulation  | Simluation file is there   |
| 5_Images and Videos  | All interfacing outputs and videos are there   |

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome
. Interfacing the embedded code with Atmeg328 microcontroller . so, i refered youtube videos and the some paper on embedded c

. Circuit connection to overcome this i have refred course materials related to SimulIDE software.
